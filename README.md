# Security Application Using CNN
The concept of Neural Networks in the realm of Deep Learning has undeniably been one of the most notable breakthroughs in Machine Learning and AI. In this paper, we elaborate and further apply the concepts of Deep Learning algorithms namely Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) in image classification. We have curated a workable dataset of 4000 images of toddlers and obtained the dataset of pets(dogs/cats) from Kaggle¹. We used CNN to train our model over several epochs to obtain an accurate result whilst avoiding overfitting. The model was evaluated using a classification accuracy and loss plot. The purpose of this research is to increase automation in public places such as malls, movie theatres, and similar places which host mass gatherings of people and shouldn’t include pets and other animals. Our aim through this project is to develop an intelligent application/software that can detect objects through images captured by security cameras and then classify them as permitted or not. Our project achieved this by the use of CNN for object classification and our vision is to develop an application/software which is assisted by our model to permit or block the entrance of undesired objects/animals.
Accuracy of 93.47% was obtained and the validation loss was minimized to 0.1913.
